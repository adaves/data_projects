    "Overview:\n",
    "This project involves identifying unusual patterns in stock market data that might indicate anomalies or potential fraud. It uses anomaly detection techniques rather than traditional classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "    Collect historical trading data for various stocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Preprocess the data by normalizing and cleaning it.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Apply anomaly detection algorithms like Isolation Forests or One-Class SVM to identify outliers in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Analyze detected anomalies to understand their causes.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Tools: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn."

    "I want to start a new machine learning project. It is a beginner data science finance project, for stock market price prediction. Use python, pandas, and scikit-learn.This project aims to predict whether a stock's price will go up or down based on historical data and technical indicators. This is a binary classification problem where the target variable is the direction of the stock price movement. Steps: Gather historical stock price data and calculate technical indicators such as moving averages, RSI, and MACD. Split the data into training and testing sets. Train a classification model like Random Forests or XGBoost to predict the direction of price movement. Validate the model using cross-validation techniques. Set up the jupyter notebook. Create a title, table of contents, imports, and starter code. Also anything I may have forgotten to list.\n"
